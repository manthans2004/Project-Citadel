> Reinforcing the Hill Cipher with Non-Linear Diffusion and CBC Mode

A university cryptography project focused on analyzing the classical Hill Cipher and designing a modern, more secure enhancement.

## Team Members
- Manthan S 
- Likhith U

## Project Overview
The classical Hill Cipher, while innovative for its use of matrix algebra, suffers from critical vulnerabilities like linearity and susceptibility to known-plaintext attacks. This project, "Project Citadel," aims to reinforce it by integrating:
1.  **Non-Linear Diffusion:** Using a custom S-Box to break the linear relationship.
2.  **CBC Mode:** Implementing Cipher Block Chaining to hide patterns in the plaintext.

## Objectives
- Analyze the mathematical structure and weaknesses of the original Hill Cipher.
- Design a new algorithm incorporating non-linear components.
- Demonstrate the enhanced security through a manual worked example.
- Provide pseudocode for the new encryption and decryption process.

## Current Status
ðŸš§ **Project Initialized** - Design and documentation phase.
