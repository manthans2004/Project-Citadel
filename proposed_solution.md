## 4. Conclusion

Project Citadel successfully addresses the fundamental vulnerabilities of the classical Hill Cipher. By integrating a non-linear S-Box, it defends against known-plaintext attacks and breaks the linearity that facilitates algebraic cryptanalysis. Furthermore, the implementation of Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode ensures semantic security by hiding patterns in the plaintext and providing robust diffusion.

This design demonstrates a principled approach to cryptographic enhancement, drawing on well-established modern techniques like substitution-permutation networks and secure modes of operation. While the classical Hill Cipher remains a valuable historical tool for teaching linear algebra in cryptography, Project Citadel reimagines it as a pedagogically powerful model that incorporates the essential elements of a modern block cipher.

**Future work could involve:**
*   Implementing the algorithm in software to validate its security and performance.
*   Conducting formal cryptanalysis on the proposed design.
*   Exploring more complex S-Box designs and key scheduling algorithms.

The project concludes that while creating a truly secure cipher requires extensive expert analysis, the enhancements proposed here provide a strong foundational understanding of the principles necessary for modern cryptographic design.
