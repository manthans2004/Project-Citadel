1. The Hill Cipher: A Detailed Explanation

The Hill Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra. It encrypts blocks of letters at a time, which makes it much stronger than simple substitution ciphers against frequency analysis.

Core Concept: It uses a matrix as a key to multiply against vectors of plaintext letters to produce ciphertext vectors.

Steps and Calculations:

A. Encoding the Message:

1. Choose a Block Size (`m`): This determines the size of the square key matrix. For this example, let's use m=2.
2. Convert Letters to Numbers: Typically, A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Z=25.
   · Plaintext: 'HELP'
   · H -> 7, E -> 4, L -> 11, P -> 15
3. Form Plaintext Vectors: Split the number sequence into vectors of size m.
   · Vector 1, P1: [7, 4] (HE)
   · Vector 2, P2: [11, 15] (LP)
4. Choose a Key Matrix (`K`): This must be an m x m matrix that is invertible modulo 26.
   · Let's choose a 2x2 key: K = [[3, 5], [2, 7]]
5. Encrypt Each Vector: The fundamental operation is Ciphertext Vector = (K * Plaintext Vector) mod 26.
   · For P1 = [7, 4]:
     · C1 = (K * P1) mod 26
     · First element: (3*7 + 5*4) mod 26 = (21 + 20) mod 26 = 41 mod 26 = 15 -> P
     · Second element: (2*7 + 7*4) mod 26 = (14 + 28) mod 26 = 42 mod 26 = 16 -> Q
     · C1 = [15, 16] -> PQ
   · For P2 = [11, 15]:
     · C2 = (K * P2) mod 26
     · First element: (3*11 + 5*15) mod 26 = (33 + 75) mod 26 = 108 mod 26 = 4 -> E
     · Second element: (2*11 + 7*15) mod 26 = (22 + 105) mod 26 = 127 mod 26 = 23 -> X
     · C2 = [4, 23] -> EX
6. Form the Ciphertext: Combine the output vectors.
   · Ciphertext: PQ EX -> PQEX

B. Decryption: Decryption requires finding the inverse of the key matrix modulo 26 (K⁻¹).

· The inverse of K = [[3, 5], [2, 7]] is K⁻¹ = [[15, 3], [20, 9]] (you can calculate this using the formula involving the determinant and modular inverse).
· Decrypt each vector: Plaintext Vector = (K⁻¹ * Ciphertext Vector) mod 26.
· For C1 = [15, 16]:
  · First element: (15*15 + 3*16) mod 26 = (225 + 48) mod 26 = 273 mod 26 = 7 -> H
  · Second element: (20*15 + 9*16) mod 26 = (300 + 144) mod 26 = 444 mod 26 = 4 -> E

2. Critical Limitations of the Hill Cipher

1. Vulnerability to Known-Plaintext Attack (KPA):
   · The Problem: This is its greatest weakness. If an attacker knows m pairs of plaintext and ciphertext vectors (where m is the block size), they can easily solve for the key matrix K.
   · Why: The equation C = (K * P) mod 26 is a linear system. With enough known (P, C) pairs, an attacker can set up equations to solve for the elements of K. If they know P1 and C1 from our example, they are most of the way to finding K.
2. Fully Linear Transformation:
   · The Problem: Matrix multiplication is a linear operation. Linear transformations are fundamentally less secure because they preserve the structure of the data. They are vulnerable to sophisticated algebraic cryptanalysis.
3. Lack of Diffusion (in its basic form - ECB Mode):
   · The Problem: If the same plaintext block appears twice in the message, it will produce the exact same ciphertext block. This leaks information about patterns in the plaintext.
   · Example: In our example, if the word "HE" appeared again, it would always encrypt to "PQ".
4. Restrictions on the Key Matrix:
   · The Problem: The key matrix must be invertible modulo 26. Not all matrices are, which limits the key space and complicates key generation.

3. How "Project Citadel" Overcomes These Limitations

Your project's title perfectly addresses each weakness:

1. Reinforcing with Non-Linear Diffusion:

· Solution: After the linear matrix multiplication step, pass the resulting vector through a Non-Linear S-Box (Substitution box).
· How it helps: This breaks the linear relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext. Even if an attacker knows the input and output of this new combined function, they cannot set up simple linear equations to solve for the key. The S-Box adds confusion, making algebraic attacks infeasible.

2. Reinforcing with CBC Mode (Cipher Block Chaining):

· Solution: Before encrypting a plaintext block, XOR it with the previous ciphertext block. For the first block, use a random Initialization Vector (IV).
· How it helps:
  · Eliminates Patterns: Even if the same plaintext block ("HE") appears multiple times, it will be XORed with different previous ciphertext blocks, resulting in completely different ciphertexts. This provides semantic security.
  · Propagates Errors: A change in a single plaintext bit affects all subsequent ciphertext blocks, which is a desirable property called diffusion.

Visual of the "Project Citadel" Encryption Process (for one block i):

[Plaintext Block i] -> XOR -> [Hill Cipher (K)] -> [S-Box] -> [Ciphertext Block i]                         ^                                            |                         |-----------------------[Ciphertext Block i-1] (or IV) <-----------------

Summary Table:

Limitation of Hill Cipher How "Project Citadel" Overcomes It
Known-Plaintext Attack The Non-Linear S-Box breaks the linear algebra relationship, making solving for K impossible with standard linear algebra.
Fully Linear Transformation The S-Box introduces non-linearity, which is a cornerstone of modern block cipher design (e.g., AES).
Lack of Diffusion (ECB Mode) CBC Mode ensures each ciphertext block depends on all previous blocks, hiding patterns and providing diffusion.
Complex Key Generation (This remains, but it's a minor issue. Your project focuses on the major cryptographic weaknesses.)

By combining the Hill Cipher's matrix-based strength with the non-linearity of an S-Box and the pattern-hiding power of CBC mode, "Project Citadel" transforms a historically interesting but broken cipher into a pedagogically powerful model of a modern secure cryptosystem.
